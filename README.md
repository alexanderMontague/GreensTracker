# Greens Tracker

* Greens Tracker keeps track of all temperature, moisture and hole data recorded during a hand watering shift at a golf course
* Greens Tracker was created as I was tired of recording all of this data on paper, and wanted an easy way to keep track of all previous data
* To use this application make sure Java is installed and all files are downloaded. Run by compiling with your favourite editor, or use Java GreensTrackerRun - if running through the command line, make sure the file paths are still valid, or assets will not read correctly 
* The application has been used practically at my previous job as a greenskeeper at The Oakville Golf Club
* This version is a nicer graphical representation of the C program I came up with during the summer of 2017
